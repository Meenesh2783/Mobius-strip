Outline of the Code  

The strip is modeled in a class MobiusStrip which takes care of geometry and behavior encapsulated in a Möbius strip to simplify the code. For better modularity and clarity, it follows an object-oriented design.  

__init__: A constructor (R, w, resolution) takes and validates parameters before setting computed attributes. It later invokes mesh creation and property calculation of geometry.  

Private Methods:  

_parametric_equations(): a Möbius strip is modeled using a set of standard equations and engraved in 3D space.  

_generate_mesh(): creates a grid using a set of (u,v) values.  

_compute_surface_area(): computes area of the surface area using the summation of triangle areas that are created out of mesh points.  

_compute_edge_length(): Continuously estimating the edge length of a single edge where v is fixed and u is 0 to 4pi, revolves around the strip.  

Public Methods:  

get_properties(): Fetches pre-calculated values of the area and edge length.  

plot(): draws the Strip in 3D space using Matplotlib in the form of a 3D visual strip.

Möbius Strip Surface Area Calculation

The surface area approximation for the mesh refinement Triangulation method:

In meshgrid quadrilaterals are formed from the Möbius strip.

In each quadrilateral two triangles are formed.

Using the cross product, triangle area is determined using:

Area=1/2*| AB x AC |

Area = 0.5 · ∥AB × AC∥

The entire surface area will be given by the sum of all triangular surface areas

This approach provides a reasonable level of ease alongside precision bound error, particularly at high levels of resolution (n_res = 200).

Challenges Encountered

Twist Topology Challenge: Due to the half-twist of the Möbius strip, area calculation formulas cannot be used. It was necessary to handle topology using parametric equations.

Edge Continuity Challenge: The edge wraps around twice (0 to 4π) because of the Möbius twist. This was meticulously traced for each edge length estimate.

Sensitivity to Mesh Resolution Challenge: Low geometric resolution captures important features inaccurately; high geometric resolution is computationally expensive. 

Scaling for Visualization Challenge: Setting the correct axis limits for the 3D plot required finding proper midpoints and ranges so that balance is achieved on all axes.
